This is a University Management API written in Django. 
There are three roles in this API; Staff, Instructor, and Student.
University staff has permission to define new courses and assign instructors, capacity, and exam dates to them.
Instructors can edit grades and finalize them.
Students use this API to take courses, select their favorite section, edit their courses, see their grades, and file a complaint on their grades along with an accompanying message.
I tried to normalize the database as much as possible and used Djang's best practices in developing this API.
